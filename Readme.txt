# Comments
	-I have some images about our conversation in Evaluation foldera and my teammates are not fully care about
	this final assignment.
	-Basically, we had plan up this project and started to divide the workload. I do the login,
	register, forget password and setup the navigation bar. Two others do 5 fragments (Library, Store, Friends,
	User Profile and Help and Support) and database (which I can help them a little bit about this - do research
	and try to use firebase). However, we recently met together to assembly our project, they came up with nothing.
	One of them doesn't know anything about Android and didn't attend the tutorial class. At that time, it was
	really late so I did the rest by myself.
